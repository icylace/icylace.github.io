  <h1>The Rainstorm</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    Thunder crackles through the cloudy darkness,<br />
    <span class="indent"></span>while a misty wind fills the air.<br />
    The heavy rustic sky frees its burden,<br />
    <span class="indent"></span>a torrent of rain paints the scene.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    There I witness from a bench,<br />
    <span class="indent"></span>the refreshing touch of raindrops.<br />
    The wet surroundings glisten,<br />
    <span class="indent"></span>Becoming dazzling spots of fresh.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Other people retreat indoors,<br />
    <span class="indent"></span>Avoiding the comfort in a soaked world.<br />
    Ambient noise of the rain beats hard,<br />
    <span class="indent"></span>The rhythm eases my daily burdens.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    The searing rain treats me well.
