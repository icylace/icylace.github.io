  <h1>Dots in the Sky</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    So grand yet quietly distant<br />
    in their lasting glimmer<br />
    The reliable dots in the sky<br />
    shine for their admirers<br />
    While almost spelling your name
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Your hand raises to catch one<br />
    should it decide to greet you<br />
    Don&rsquo;t reach out for just any<br />
    only ones that stay a while<br />
    Don&rsquo;t try for them all<br />
    that would be below unfair
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    There&rsquo;s one you keep pointing at<br />
    the most brilliant to your eye<br />
    It&rsquo;s looking for something to shine upon<br />
    and you fully offer your hand<br />
    But others within reach fall instead
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Still, you must aim high&hellip;
