  <h1>Poem of the Dove Ceremony</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    Grandma, Adelaida, our great grandmother,<br />
    our grandmother, our mother,<br />
    jewel at the heart of our family,<br />
    sweetly we entered your life and<br />
    you gave us your lasting joy and love,<br />
    And with you we send our deepest love,<br />
    our boundless gratitude.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Now as you leave we stand together<br />
    to say good-bye,<br />
    And as you ascend to the angels<br />
    we hold your name in our hearts,<br />
    your memory shining bright.
