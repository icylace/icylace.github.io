  <h1>If All Is Fire</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    Whispers<br />
    Fiery winds call out<br />
    Pulsing from a mortal frame
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Sandstorms and embers<br />
    Cry out<br />
    Down and flickering
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Terrifying sparks<br />
    Like ghosts on a weave<br />
    Brimming over the horizon
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    If all is fire
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Phantoms become flame
  </section>
  <div class="part2">
    <section class="stanza">
      Vapors<br />
      Stale riverbeds recoil slowly<br />
      Surging with dust
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      Grey death<br />
      Plumes proudly<br />
      Ashen pillows teeming with laughter
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      Vibrant memories<br />
      Glowing warmth and searing passion<br />
      Brighten the depths
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      Blazing hands<br />
      Aching from their burning caress<br />
      Leaving cinders and silence
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      If all is fire
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      Away the world burns
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      But
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      All is fire
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      At the rhythm of your name.
