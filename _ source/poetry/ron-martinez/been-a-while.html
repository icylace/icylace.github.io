  <h1>Been A While</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    I was minding my own business,<br />
    enjoying a drink in the cafe,<br />
    working hard as usual,<br />
    when I noticed a strange girl,<br />
    standing in line by the counter,<br />
    who was smiling at me.

  <section class="stanza">
    I&rsquo;m pretty sure it was me,<br />
    no one else here in the corner,<br />
    it&rsquo;s not like I was bothered,<br />
    just maybe a little surprised.

      I tried to ignore her,<br />
      I was focusing on my work,<br />
      but she kept smiling at me,<br />
      the corner of my eye couldn&rsquo;t avoid it.

    <section class="stanza">
      Finally,<br />
      I gave up and looked at her,<br />
      she was sipping her fresh coffee,<br />
      her smile was still mine.

    <section class="stanza">
      I should at least return the smile,<br />
      and that&rsquo;s exactly what I did.<br />
      She then nodded mysteriously<br />
      and walked out the door.

      What a strange girl.<br />
      I watched her as she left.<br />
      The afternoon wind played with her hair.<br />
      She took another sip of her coffee.
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      She was probably just passing by.
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      As I wondered about her,<br />
      I wanted to go eat some ice cream.<br />
      It&rsquo;s been a while<br />
      since I felt like that.
