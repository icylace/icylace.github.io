  <h1>Fate&rsquo;s Reprise</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    I&rsquo;ve heard the voice of an angel falling,<br />
    and felt the pulse of a primal calling,<br />
    and within this recurring nightly rapture,<br />
    I dreamt a dream I longed to capture,<br />
    an elusive image I&rsquo;ve held to heart,<br />
    a secret setting in a secluded world,<br />
    with all the time I would never have,<br />
    to see the face that haunts my dreams,<br />
    to hear this utterance that justifies hope,

    &ldquo;I have always missed you.&rdquo;

  <section class="stanza">
    Then the sunrise begins,<br />
    and daybreak shatters the trance.<br />
    If only time would grant me pardon,<br />
    in fate&rsquo;s reprise.
