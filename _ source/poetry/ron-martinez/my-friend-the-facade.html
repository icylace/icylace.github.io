  <h1>My Friend the Facade</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    The apology in front of the grin,<br />
    the gloating over the win,<br />
    these things were said,<br />
    by my friend the Facade.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    An exaggerated victory story,<br />
    with equally embellished glory,<br />
    these lies were spread,<br />
    by my good friend the Facade.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    A patronizing stare with a smile,<br />
    A degrading glare all the while,<br />
    these looks were made,<br />
    by my close friend the Facade.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    A million truths to backup the lie,<br />
    now I seem to know why,<br />
    these fallacies were made,<br />
    by my dear friend the Facade.
