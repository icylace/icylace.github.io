  <h1>The Mirror</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    What has remained the same<br />
    when I see my friends<br />
    move on with their lives<br />
    is how I miss them.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    The happiness they&rsquo;ve achieved<br />
    is the same that I seek<br />
    but instead of envy<br />
    there&rsquo;s only desire<br />
    to be with them.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    My reflection<br />
    is not the face that I see<br />
    but the aura of my friends<br />
    whose laughter and tears shine brightly<br />
    when the sun hits the mirror.

      If I never make it<br />
      to where they are<br />
      I wonder who I will become<br />
      but yet I know<br />
      we will reunite someday<br />
      if for no other reason<br />
      than I love them.
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      To cherish friends<br />
      is to embrace yourself.<br />
      To find old friends<br />
      is to find missing shards of your soul.

    <section class="stanza">
      That is the secret after all.
