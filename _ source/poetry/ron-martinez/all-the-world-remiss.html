  <h1>All the World Remiss</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    Your eyes are stars, the wind carries your voice,<br />
    It&rsquo;s such a peaceful night to think of you,<br />
    I&rsquo;d bring you back if there was a choice,<br />
    You were the soothing stream within my view.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    I now know what the rain can take and bring,<br />
    But your hand guides me throughout my solemness,<br />
    And, like a nightingale, at night I sing,<br />
    About your sunshine after pouring sadness.

  <section class="stanza">
    This night we could have been in our rapture,<br />
    The very feeling that I ever miss,<br />
    In a moment which I yearn to capture,<br />
    When eyes dream, lips meet, and we kiss!
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Those memories do haunt me, find my door,<br />
    Oh, I miss thee and here I love you more!
