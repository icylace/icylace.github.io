  <section class="stanza">
    I&rsquo;ve had such a heavy heart,<br />
    I&rsquo;ve been carrying it all along
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    It&rsquo;s been such a long time<br />
    Since I&rsquo;ve seen you around
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    I&rsquo;ve been so far away<br />
    But now I&rsquo;m hear to stay
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    I&rsquo;ve never felt so alive<br />
    As when you&rsquo;re by my side
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    You were the only one<br />
    I&rsquo;ve never stopped thinking of you
