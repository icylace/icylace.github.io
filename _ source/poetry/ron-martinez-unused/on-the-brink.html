  <h1>On the Brink</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    Here I am at the edge of the cliffside of a mountain<br />
    that I spent many years struggling to climb.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Here I stand at the end of destiny,<br />
    leaning forward into the unknown.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    My thoughts claim death,<br />
    my heart claims life.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Rebirth of the soul.<br />
    Rebirth of the light.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Still, this is the end I feel,<br />
    And how full of relief I feel,
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    to experience the death of fear,<br />
    the death of expectation,
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    the death of illusion,<br />
    the death of regret.
