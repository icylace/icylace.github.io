  <h1>World Progress</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    Through ages past and destinies awakened,<br />
    this world was born.<br />
    The fruit of time, the boon of ideals,<br />
    the embodiment of the struggle.<br />
    But how many of each is content with their own,<br />
    and how many more beneath dream of it.<br />
    Though our world has went forth in our eyes,<br />
    this world has only made a half-motion to a forward step.
