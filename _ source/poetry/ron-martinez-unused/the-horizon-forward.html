  <h1>The Horizon Forward</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    a rocky road lies ahead,<br />
    and naively do I set forth,<br />
    against wind, rain, and thunder,<br />
    I face each anew with every step,
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    the tide of change is yet unbroken,<br />
    and further I strive with no curse spoken,<br />
    for a tempered will has been my guide,<br />
    that untamed fire of survival&rsquo;s strength
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    a thickened mist blankets the horizon,<br />
    but my sight never could reach as far,<br />
    so for my view it does not matter,<br />
    my journey ahead may be short-lived
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    into the uncertain I carry my sighs,<br />
    with a soldier&rsquo;s pride, stride for stride,<br />
    should I fall, once more I shall rise,<br />
    at first I walk, eventually I crawl
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    and no kindred soul may lend their hand,<br />
    for on this journey I take, I take alone,<br />
    no encountered peril can claim my last breath,<br />
    for the destination is enough to live for
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    no pace of sorrow will see me die,<br />
    for on this road I travel, I&rsquo;ve walked before,<br />
    and any witness shall bear my head held high,<br />
    on this forsaken path I wander
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    to reach my horizon, I struggle to tread forward,<br />
    and tireless still, I solemnly press onward.
