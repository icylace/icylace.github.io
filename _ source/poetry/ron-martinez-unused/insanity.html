  <h1>Insanity</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    Such a gray endless feeling,<br />
    such a strange scornful reeling,<br />
    to be screaming in fright,<br />
    at the blankness of night,<br />
    while seeing an abundance of creatures,<br />
    flamboyant and without features,<br />
    that stalk the houses<br />
    and torture the mouses,<br />
    swirls in the head,<br />
    with dreams of the dead,<br />
    that could render the sane,<br />
    to leap from window panes.

  <section class="stanza">
    To have a feeling so removed,<br />
    from the containment of the room,<br />
    to peer upon a mirror,<br />
    to the shock of the seer,<br />
    to see the reflection that proved,<br />
    what horrors of doom,<br />
    permeates the scene,<br />
    creeping nearer and nearer,<br />
    would set the soul afire,<br />
    letting the nightmares conspire,<br />
    to dance in the head,<br />
    even while asleep in bed.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    And to turn, run away,<br />
    into the dismal light of the fading day,<br />
    then to fall, and then lay,<br />
    as sanity sprouts wings and flies away.
