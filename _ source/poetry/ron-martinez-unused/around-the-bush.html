    You know how it is<br />
    you read between the lines<br />
    you hear unspoken words<br />
    and try to find a revelation
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Do you play the game?<br />
    is this how it feels?<br />
    I must be losing my mind<br />
    but I swear I know what I heard
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    She must be wondering<br />
    I know how it feels
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    I know what they say<br />
    they must know how it is<br />
    it won't take me that long<br />
    to listen as I should
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    but this is how the game is played<br />
    not sure how the other feels<br />
    but all that will change<br />
    because it's now my turn to take the risk
