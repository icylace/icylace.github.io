  <h1>No Desire</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    to walk in the sunlight<br />
    where your shadow persists<br />
    if I am your savior<br />
    then why do you resist?
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    to feed my anger<br />
    walk in the clouds<br />
    evading every passion<br />
    in the world to atone
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    if I am the moonlight<br />
    and you feel alone<br />
    then why do you shudder<br />
    as I enter your home?
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    to be as the stranger<br />
    as your eyes in a way<br />
    and sit by the embers,<br />
    the dying light of day
