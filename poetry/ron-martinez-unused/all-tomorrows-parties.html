  <h1>All Tomorrow&#8217;s Parties</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    I get down<br />
    I get angry<br />
    I get bitter and so sad<br />
    But when a wink comes my way<br />
    I smile at distant lights
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    I get poor<br />
    I get lonely<br />
    I get regretful and so quiet<br />
    But when someone listens a little<br />
    I can easily rest at night
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    I get lost<br />
    I get dreaming<br />
    I&rsquo;m always there and yet invisible<br />
    But if someone says they want me<br />
    Then there&rsquo;s something to look forward to
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    I&rsquo;ve been used<br />
    I&rsquo;ve been forgotten<br />
    But I can be joyful and carefree<br />
    Just meet me at the party<br />
    And I&rsquo;ll be with you in your laughter
