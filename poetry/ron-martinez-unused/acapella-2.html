  <h1>Acapella 2</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    In the cover of midnight,<br />
    there by the waterfront,<br />
    I couldn&rsquo;t believe it was true,<br />
    that it was always you,

    It&rsquo;s the way that you do it,<br />
    the way that you say it,<br />
    It&rsquo;s the every motion of each step in your walk,

    It&rsquo;s the way that you look at me,<br />
    talking so softly,<br />
    it&rsquo;s the gleam of the moonbeams in your eyes&hellip;
