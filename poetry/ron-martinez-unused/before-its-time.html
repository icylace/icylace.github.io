  <h1>Before It&rsquo;s Time</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    I stand on the brink of annihilation<br />
    My world is falling in on itself<br />
    <span class="indent"></span>toward one moment<br />
    where my chains of doubt and fear snap<br />
    and I am finally free to delivery my<br />
    <span class="indent"></span>one last act of redemption.<br />
    I stand at the edge of a cliff<br />
    There I prepare to welcome death<br />
    <span class="indent"></span>with open arms<br />
    I see only the horizon<br />
    <span class="indent"></span>and set off after it darkens.
