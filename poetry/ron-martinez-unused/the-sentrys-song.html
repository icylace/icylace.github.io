    they leave me behind in this small place<br />
    to keep watch over this little flower<br />
    i&rsquo;m almost glad to be given such an honor<br />
    but i don&rsquo;t want to be here<br />
    i want to be outside of this box<br />
    too bad because of this strange little flower<br />
    that swears on its life it needs me
