  <h1>Invaders from a Distant Cloud</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    Countless invaders from a distant cloud<br />
    <span class="indent"></span>quietly carrying out their winter invasion.<br />
    How do you small white dots manage to<br />
    <span class="indent"></span>fall into wondrous inconvenient piles?
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Their clever world domination strategy<br />
    <span class="indent"></span>plays out in parts by cloudy days.<br />
    Your curious determination to always fall.<br />
    <span class="indent"></span>Who gave you such motivation?
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Their stubborn resolve brings more of them falling<br />
    <span class="indent"></span>to replace their shoveled forerunners.<br />
    Must your blank persistence remain unmoved<br />
    <span class="indent"></span>despite already conquering rooftops and lakes?

    <section class="stanza">
      Their invasion of the ground calmly rages<br />
      <span class="indent"></span>on through the long hours.<br />
      Why must you blanket innocent parked cars<br />
      <span class="indent"></span>in binding layers of fluffiness and ice?
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      Their bold hatred of stationary vehicles<br />
      <span class="indent"></span>must truly be boundless.<br />
      You little soft invaders force me to<br />
      <span class="indent"></span>shovel away your dreams of empire.
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      I displace these nameless invaders<br />
      into mounds that become<br />
      cold pillows in the night.<br />
      But I&rsquo;m not fighting them<br />
      and this isn't war.
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      Hopefully, at least some<br />
      will simply enjoy<br />
      their time as snowflakes<br />
      for as long as they can.
