  <h1>Under Palest Moonlight</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    My journey home began quietly enough.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    I, peddling silently towards the bike path,<br />
    noticed the vibrant moonlight<br />
    guiding my way down the street.<br />
    I entered the path in anticipation<br />
    for I would encounter the wooden bridge<br />
    over the river within fleeting moments.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    And there it was before me,<br />
    stretched out into the distance.<br />
    I came to rest above the river&rsquo;s center.<br />
    Leaning on the wooden railing,<br />
    I admired the crisp circle of the moon<br />
    for it had never been clearer.<br />
    The rippling water glistened under<br />
    the lights of the nearby bridge<br />
    meant for motor vehicles.<br />
    A passing ambulance flashed its lights.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    The moment was eventually taken<br />
    and my ride resumed with a fresh, eerie allure.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Silhouettes of trees danced ahead<br />
    in all manner of crisscrossing patterns.<br />
    Soon, I was able to leave the trail<br />
    to traverse the expanse of a farm field.<br />
    There awaited the naked majesty of the sky<br />
    whereby the stars were royalty.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Again, I stopped for the view<br />
    but it was shorter now since<br />
    an oncoming set of bright dots<br />
    further down the road<br />
    urged me to be on my way.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Emerging from the field,<br />
    I came upon the ghostly lit road<br />
    leading back to the trail.<br />
    Its length was short<br />
    but its beauty, transcendent.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Returning to the path,<br />
    I focused on completing my ride.<br />
    My sentiments were satiated<br />
    and the luxury of zoning out<br />
    was afforded to me.<br />
    Absent of needless worries,<br />
    my mind was celebratory<br />
    at the lack of such traffic.<br />
    It was almost free to,<br />
    dare I say, daydream?
  </section>

    <section class="stanza">
      A lone flickering light caught my attention.<br />
      It was another bike rider, who,<br />
      despite their opposite heading,<br />
      was a fellow traveler.<br />
      As we crossed paths I noted their brisk<br />
      yet leisurely pace, the same as mine.
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      Eventually came the lights of a sports field.<br />
      It lit up the trail even more so<br />
      since trees were increasingly obscuring the moon.<br />
      As I passed alongside it,<br />
      the lights were shut off and my path,<br />
      save for my trusty headlight,<br />
      committed to darkness.
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      Not long thereafter I disembarked<br />
      from the ongoing bike path<br />
      to travel through the final set of streets.<br />
      Much relaxing downhill riding occurred there.<br />
      Even the literal bump in the road<br />
      was a welcome sign<br />
      of how close I was home.
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      Soon, I came upon my street<br />
      and as I glided down towards the end of it,<br />
      I nearly crashed through large piles of leaves<br />
      calmly sleeping on top of pavement.
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      Wouldn&rsquo;t that have been embarrassing.
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      I stopped by the mailbox.<br />
      Nothing was in it.
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      I eased in towards the moonlit facade of my house.<br />
      Well, the place I rent.
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      No lights were on.
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      Soon, I would have to be discerning in my movements<br />
      to avoid disturbing those who were sleeping inside.
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      I parked my bike on the porch and<br />
      stepped out onto the walkway.<br />
      Looking up, I tried tracing the moon into my memory.<br />
      Perhaps I&rsquo;ll see it again tonight if I dream.
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      I went indoors to be greeted<br />
      by the warm fire of the wood stove.
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      And this was my journey home.
