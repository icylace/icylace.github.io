  <h1>The Great Accident</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    The sum of our life choices<br />
    may steer our commonplace lives<br />
    but the nature of destiny<br />
    sees reality flowing<br />
    beyond the controllable.

  <section class="stanza">
    It&rsquo;s on days much like today<br />
    that I&rsquo;m caught with deep wonder<br />
    of how we ever crossed paths.

  <section class="stanza">
    It&rsquo;s on days much like today<br />
    I thank you for existing.
