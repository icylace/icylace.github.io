  <h1>Sunlit Waterfall</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    An embracing warm mist<br />
    invited me to stay<br />
    by a sunlit waterfall.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Once a barren cliff<br />
    bears now a roaring stream<br />
    ending in white splashes<br />
    against supine rocks.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Through this vertical deluge,<br />
    I heard the haunting voice<br />
    of a shimmering phantom<br />
    obscured behind the falling water.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    I could not guess why she was there.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    I only knew the beauty of her song.

    <section class="stanza">
      The fellow lament<br />
      of the missing half<br />
      of my broken heart?
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      The siren&rsquo;s pitch<br />
      that cracked it<br />
      in the first place?
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      A peer expressing truth<br />
      in this<br />
      world of deception?
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      Which it is<br />
      whether any<br />
      or all<br />
      or none<br />
      I cannot say.
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      But dare I wonder<br />
      I'll find out<br />
      soon enough.
