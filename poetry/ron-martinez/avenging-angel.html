  <h1>Avenging Angel</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    A passionate indignation raises me,<br />
    and wrought with the sighs of anguish,<br />
    a seething vengeance becomes me.<br />
    Every facet of my being burns in atonement,<br />
    emanating the brilliance of an accusing light.<br />
    Fate would have me cast down a belated justice,<br />
    long forgotten under the shame of our forebears.<br />
    And when I have fallen,<br />
    my fury shall reap the world of my victimizers,<br />
    and there will be no innocence&hellip;
