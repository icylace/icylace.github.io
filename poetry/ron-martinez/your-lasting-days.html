  <h1>Your Lasting Days</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    Though your heart is not now that passion<br />
    which in youthful years made you dream,<br />
    that which you have, you have.<br />
    An honest love,<br />
    purest in form and tempered by regret,<br />
    yet enduring in hope and endearing in desire.<br />
    &rsquo;Til your final moments<br />
    you would spend all your remaining days<br />
    in search of your happiness.<br />
    To love.<br />
    To be loved.<br />
    To have.<br />
    And finally let go.
