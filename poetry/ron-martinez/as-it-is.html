  <h1>As It Is</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    As it is with new things<br />
    and new friends<br />
    many lessons are learned.

    Perspective expands,<br />
    skills improve,<br />
    old ambitions rekindle.

    My heart is where<br />
    it has always been.<br />
    In a place where<br />
    our past is forgiven.

      And when I share what<br />
      I have found with you<br />
      I will see you<br />
      for the first time<br />
      in the way you<br />
      tried telling me<br />
      in the first place&mdash;

      but not my destiny.
