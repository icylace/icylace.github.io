  <h1>Bitter Rose</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    The last, lovely rose, against an ocean of sand,<br />
    with its proud, weakened stance kneeling to the ground,<br />
    and its striking petals fading off their dying stem,<br />
    with its vibrant, tired colors succumbing to dust,<br />
    and amidst the power of the cold, unforgiving wind,<br />
    still faithfully smiles up at the sky,<br />
    toward the forsaking cloud-covered sun.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    To the hopeful rose, rain would soon come,<br />
    and the sun would once more shine,<br />
    but rain never falls,<br />
    and sunlight is never felt,<br />
    and this flower diminishes.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    How joyous a death it must be,<br />
    to be engulfed by the heat of the sun,<br />
    or to drown in a barrage of droplets.<br />
    But to silently suffocate in neither extreme,<br />
    to fade in this dull way,<br />
    is the final failure.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    So, this lovely flower,<br />
    at the mercy of the elements,<br />
    cringes to accept its fate,<br />
    as indeed it is a bitter, bitter rose&hellip;
