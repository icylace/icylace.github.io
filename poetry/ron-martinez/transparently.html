  <h1>Transparently</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    In this world I dwell<br />
    where am I to be seen?<br />
    If you ask someone next to me<br />
    they may shake their head.<br />
    Then you may wonder about that,<br />
    since I&rsquo;m there by their side.<br />
    And when you tell them,<br />
    they turn baffled,<br />
    walking away,<br />
    dropping their trash<br />
    for me to pick up.
