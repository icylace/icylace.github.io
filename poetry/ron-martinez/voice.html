  <h1>Voice</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    How well are you heard?<br />
    How do you speak out?<br />
    What words gain attention?
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Where is your voice?<br />
    Is your tongue cut out?<br />
    Would you speak if no one listened?
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Why wait forever?<br />
    To place blame for missed opportunity?<br />
    Do you prefer it this way?
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Where do you go to scream?<br />
    Who really cares?<br />
    It is moot speculation<br />
    until your voice is found.
