  <h1>Requiem</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    In your loving memory,<br />
    I recite my passage of tears,<br />
    my reflection along your path,<br />
    I ask for forgiveness,<br />
    I should have been the one your eyes beheld last,
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    and in your loving memory,<br />
    I stand here, by the sunrise,<br />
    finally understanding why you awoke so early for all these years,<br />
    and then I come to think,<br />
    nothing looked so beautiful as your silhouette complementing the sky,
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    an image burned in my eyes,<br />
    for as long as I hold dear your loving memory&hellip;
