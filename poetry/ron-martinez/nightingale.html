  <h1>Nightingale</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    The fade of sunset to comfort thyself,<br />
    dear nightingale, you weep as do me.<br />
    Your tragic stance of solitude,<br />
    a dying tree your aging reminder.<br />
    To dwell upon a lonely branch,<br />
    nightingale, oh, how I cherish thee.
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Full moon illuminates thy soul,<br />
    dear nightingale, thy form is a shadow.<br />
    Your solemn song of forbearance,<br />
    with the mellowing wind your chorus.<br />
    To hold thy righteous place,<br />
    nightingale, oh, how I sing with thee.
