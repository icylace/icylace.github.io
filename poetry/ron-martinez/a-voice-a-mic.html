  <h1>A Voice, A Mic</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    Oh, how loud I would be,<br />
    how voyeuristic my tongue would be,<br />
    Had I a microphone in hand<br />
    I would deafen every passers-by<br />
    With the venom of my diatribe<br />
    I would scream and glare<br />
    And I&rsquo;d rant and rave<br />
    And I would shout to sing
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Oh, how cathartic it would be<br />
    In the rapture of the microphone and me<br />
    To be rid of shackling silence<br />
    And roar with a tempest of pity and wail

      Oh, tis a listener I find in thee<br />
      And tis a brooding man I be<br />
      How I&rsquo;d sing damned thoughts about damned men<br />
      And shriek like the poor entrapped mouse<br />
      I&rsquo;d flail my tongue spitting my every spite<br />
      and tumultuous cry trembling the world<br />
      And even the deaf and ignorant would heed it

    <section class="stanza">
      And when their attention is finally under my power,<br />
      I would simply&hellip;stop
