  <h1>Thoughts of a Wanderer</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    It is especially rare to find someone<br />
    who has a fullness in their personality<br />
    that matches of the vividness of their beauty.<br />
    Once, long ago, in a quiet, unexpected place,<br />
    I met a young woman of such kind.<br />
    In her I&rsquo;ve found all that is worthy of the day and night,<br />
    the warmth of her beaming smile,<br />
    the serenity in her starry gaze.<br />
    She is both proud in stride and<br />
    strong in will and in her elegant debonair<br />
    I cannot help but be awed in her presence.

    There is a fiery lushness to the flow of her hair<br />
    and she has a gleaming brightness in the deepness of her eyes.<br />
    Her figure is the completion of a sculptor&rsquo;s dream,<br />
    so memorable in form and wordless in perfection.<br />
    Her motion is soothing in its naturalness,<br />
    yet firmly aware when in action.

      She has a merciful ear and<br />
      would gladly lend her comforting touch<br />
      to those who would need it.<br />
      She speaks with the wisest of temperaments<br />
      and the calmness of her voice eases the<br />
      burdens of any troubled mind.<br />
      She is an angel, in both appearance and kindness,<br />
      whose joyous laughter can mend even shattered hearts.

    <section class="stanza">
      She encompasses all the hopes of sunrise<br />
      and all the lessons of sunset.<br />
      And here I am, through my longest travels,<br />
      writing these meek, inadequate words in honor of her.<br />
      And in my wandering, my aimless wandering,<br />
      I think of how wonderful it would be to be with her.
