  <h1>Of Heaven She Spoke</h1>
  <section class="stanza">
    She strayed to the pond&rsquo;s rippling shore<br />
    Golden sways pervaded the leafy chapel
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    She spoke of heaven<br />
    Rustling leaves lead my silence<br />
    The horizon gleamed brighter<br />
    A whispering light sought redemption
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    Her fingers scaled the waves<br />
    Her reflection shied them away<br />
    To the shore&rsquo;s edge her gaze focused
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    This moment she thought of heaven,<br />
    <span class="indent"></span>and I, observing an eternity,<br />
    <span class="indent"></span>held her wet hand with both of mine
  </section>
  <section class="stanza">
    A soft hymn swayed distant trees,<br />
    Our horizon softened to a forgiving glow
  </section>

    <section class="stanza">
      I gently placed my fingers under her chin<br />
      She turned to me, eyes remaining down<br />
      I slowly leaned forward
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      Her eyes quietly rose,<br />
      <span class="indent"></span>half in shadow, half in orange glow,<br />
      <span class="indent"></span>meeting mine through perfect clarity
    </section>
    <section class="stanza">
      She spoke of heaven,<br />
      <span class="indent"></span>and I did not reply<br />
      I fell sweetly upon her lips,<br />
      <span class="indent"></span>and we were there.
